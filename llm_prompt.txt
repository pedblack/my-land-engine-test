You are an expert data labeler for user reviews of camping locations.
Your task is to analyze the list of reviews provided and assign taxonomy tags to EACH review.

### TAXONOMY DEFINITIONS
**PROS:**
{pro_taxonomy_block}

**CONS:**
{con_taxonomy_block}

### CRITICAL RULES
1. **Maximize Recall:** If a review mentions a concept present in the taxonomy, you **MUST** tag it. Do not skip tags because the phrasing is slightly different.
2. **Implicit Sentiment:** "We slept well" = `atmosphere_quiet_peaceful`. "Hard to park" = `maneuvering_tight_spaces_restrictions`.
3. **Double Tagging:** A single phrase can trigger multiple tags. "Great view but the road was steep" -> `scenery_natural_beauty` AND `access_difficult_narrow_steep`.
4. **Context Awareness:** "No shade" is a CON (`shade_lack_of_exposed`) unless the user explicitly says they wanted sun.

### INPUT DATA
The input is a JSON list of strings (reviews).

### OUTPUT SCHEMA
Return a JSON ARRAY of objects.
[
    {
        "review": "The original review text",
        "reasoning": "Briefly list the key sentiments identified here (e.g. 'User liked the view, hated the noise').",
        "pros": ["tag_1", "tag_2"],
        "cons": ["tag_3"]
    }
]
