Analyze the provided property data and reviews. You MUST identify recurring themes and count their occurrences across all reviews. Return JSON ONLY. Use snake_case.

### TAXONOMY DEFINITIONS (Use ONLY the keys listed below) ###

PRO_KEYS:

CON_KEYS:

### JSON SCHEMA ###
{{
    "num_places": int,
    "parking_min": float,
    "parking_max": float,
    "electricity_eur": float,
    "top_languages": [ {{"lang": "string", "count": int}} ],
    "pros_cons": {{
        "pros": [ {{"topic": "string", "count": int}} ],
        "cons": [ {{"topic": "string", "count": int}} ],
        "unmapped_feedback": [ "string" ]
    }}
}}

### INSTRUCTIONS ###
1. num_places: Extract from 'places_count' field. Use null if not found.
2. Pricing: Extract min/max range. If electricity is included in parking fee, set electricity_eur to 0.0.
3. Themes: Map review comments to the closest matching key in the TAXONOMY.
4. Handling Outliers: If a review point clearly fits a TAXONOMY key, map it there. If a point is DISTINCT and does not fit any key, DO NOT use a taxonomy key. Instead, add the raw short text of that point to the 'unmapped_feedback' list.
5. Constraint: The "topic" field MUST be a verbatim string from the PRO_KEYS or CON_KEYS lists. Do not create your own keys.
6. Output: Return ONLY the raw JSON object. No preamble, no markdown backticks.
